      <h1>About Website</h1>
      <h3>Intended User's</h3>
        <p>
          Employers. Also, family and friends so that they have some idea of what I do professionally.
          Its easier to browse a website than to look at millions of lines of server code
          that I have developed in my career.
        </p>
      <h3>Logging In</h3>
        <p>
        If you don't login, you can still browse items and add
        them to your shopping cart. It is only when you "Check Out" that you need
        to simply login with your google login/password. A google facility is used for
        login validation; therefore, I can't see or store your login or password.
        </p>
      <h3>Using Website</h3>
        <p>
        Navigate and click on what ever you want, this website is intuitive.
        When you "Place Order", the website simply says that your order was a success
        and you are not charged because credit card info is not obtained.
        Just think of it as pretending to buy something.
        </p>
      <h3>Website Technologies</h3>
        <p>
        This website may seem fundamental, but it packs sought after technology allowing
        it to be further developed into a industry strength commerce website.
        This website is a SPA (Single Page Application) written in Angular 6 TypeScript.
        It uses a Firebase realtime NoSQL database, Bootstrap 4 components and Font Awesome icons, as well
        as other software that you can see in the package.json depencies from the source code for
        this website that is stored in GitHub at URL: https://github.com/jerry-carney/jerry-shop <br><br>
        <!-- <a class="nav-link" href="https://github.com/jerry-carney/jerry-shop">Source Code</a> -->

        This website also has some cool product admin capabilities which I can grant you permissions via your
        request.
